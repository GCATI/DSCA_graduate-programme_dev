# Introduction

Statistics is a broadly applied term. For the purposes of this course, we use the term in reference to **any process undertaken to communicate understanding about a population (of numbers)**. Some widely used, topical and familiar statistics for your consideration:

1. Mean(arithmetic), median, mode, harmonic mean, gemoetric mean
2. Standard deviation, variance, range, interquartile range
3. R number, rates, rates per capita
4. Service points won in tennis
5. Stock market indices

It can be difficult for the average person to take a series of numbers and infer some meaning from their distribution. **Summary statistics** are often used to help people think more clearly about the distribution of numbers.
