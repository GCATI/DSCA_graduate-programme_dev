# Dependencies

This notebook uses the `reticulate` package to run python code chunks. In order to run all chunks or knit the markdown, you will need to have python installed on your computer. You may also need to run the following code if you are receiving errors that look like this: `Error in path.expand(path) : invalid 'path' argument`.

```{python}
# library(reticulate)
# use_python("/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3")
# py_run_string("import os as os")
# py_run_string("os.environ['QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH'] = 'C:/Python36/Library/plugins/platforms'")

```
Ensure that you locate the path to your python executable and replace the path included in the `use_python` function above. On an ONS laptop, I found that reticulate worked fine out of the box when running R version 3.4.0, but that later versions would not run python code chunks.

If the above does not resolve your situation, you are more than welcome to follow along in Spyder of Jupyter by copying out the exercises. Please let me know if this is the case and I can ensure I adapt the pace to account for this. It is also good to have this feedback to help improve course design in more than one language.  


# Introduction

Statistics is a broadly applied term. For the purposes of this course, we use the term in reference to <strong class="navy">any process undertaken to communicate understanding about a population (of numbers)</strong>. Some widely used, topical and familiar statistics for your consideration:

1. Mean(arithmetic), median, mode, harmonic mean, gemoetric mean, trimmed mean, <strong class="navy">peri peri mean</strong>
2. Standard deviation, variance, range, interquartile range
3. R number, rates, rates per capita, [indices](https://gov.wales/welsh-index-multiple-deprivation)
4. Service points won in tennis
5. Stock market indices


If data is the raw material, statistics would be the tools used to extract valuable meaning. No tool is perfect, but some are better suited to certain jobs than others.


![Coal drilling machinery](../../www/week_2/Twentymile_Underground_Coal_Mine.png)


It can be difficult for most people to take a series of numbers and infer some meaning from their distribution. <strong class="navy">Summary statistics</strong> are often used to help people think more clearly about the distribution of numbers. Summary statistics are sometimes known as desrciptive statistics. Whenever we collapse a group of numbers into a single, take-away value, we lose some element of nuance and we need to be aware of this. Summary statistics can be helpful or; intentional or not; misleading.

<span class="quote">"It's easy to lie with statistics, but it's hard to tell the truth without it". <br> <strong>Andrejs Dunkels.</strong> </span>

The Data science Campus' corporate statement is:
<strong class="navy">Data Science for Public Good.</strong>

Therefore, we need to arm ourselves with an intuition and sound understanding of the utility and potential misuse of statistics.

## Exercise 1 <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> 

For this exercise we will be using the `sleep` dataset from the `datasets` package in R. You may choose to complete the task either in R or Python below. 

### Sleep data dictionary

<strong class="navy">Description</strong>

Data which show the effect of two soporific drugs (increase in hours of sleep compared to control) on 10 patients.


+------+----------------+--------------------------+
|Column|Data Type (in R)|Description               |
+======+================+==========================+
|1     |Numeric         |increase in hours of sleep|
+------+----------------+--------------------------+
|2     |Factor          |drug given                |
+------+----------------+--------------------------+
|3     |Factor          |patient ID                |
+------+----------------+--------------------------+


```{r include=FALSE}
# R setup chunk
sleep_r <- datasets::sleep
#sleep_py <- r_to_py(sleep_r)
```



```{python include=FALSE}
# python setup chunk
sleep_py = r.sleep_r
```

### Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Using the `sleep_py` dataframe:

1. import pandas
2. Check the dimensions of the dataframe
3. Check the data types of all columns
4. produce summary statistics on all of its columns.

#### your code 
```{python}
# import pandas
import pandas as pd
# check the dimensions
 
# check the data types

# produce summary statistics for all columns

```

<strong class="navy">Pause for thought</strong> <i class="fa fa-question-circle" id="body"></i> 

Observing the summary statistics of the `extra` column, did you notice any interesting observations? What else would you need to do in order to ascertain whether the treatment had an affect on the typical sleep duration?



# Central Tendency

One of the most commonly employed summary statistics is the <strong class="navy">average</strong>. The average seeks to describe the 'typical' observation, and there are a multitude of averages available. Two of the most important averages are the <strong class="navy">mean</strong> and <strong class="navy">median</strong>.


Both of these averages are measures of central tendency, in that they communicate an aspect of the 'typical' observation of a population. 

As we were all taught in school:

* The mean is the sum of all observations divided by the number of observations. There are slightly adjusted equations for calculating population and sample mean, but that is beyond scope for this topic.

__$\bar{X} = \frac{\Sigma x}{n}$__

* If you sorted a group of numbers from smallest to lowest, the median would be the observation in the middle. Exactly half of the observations would be above and below this value. If the number of observations is even, the median value would be exactly halfway between the 2. The equation for calculating the <strong class="navy">position of the median</strong> is lesser known than the mean:

__$\{(n + 1) รท 2\}^{th} value$__


The mean and median respond differently to the presence of outliers in a population. Let's take a look at a slightly silly context to help build the required intuition.

## Exercise 2a <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> 

It's 2019. Ten people were sat at a bar. They were comparing their salaries. Strangely, it turned out that they all earned precisely the [UK median annual income](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1002964/average-full-time-annual-earnings-in-the-uk/).

<img src="../../www/week_2/bartender.jfif" class="center" alt="creative commons bartender serving drinks"/>

Using either R or Python, store this information in an appropriate format.



### Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

1. Import numpy
2. Assign the median salary to a named value
3. Create a numpy array of 10 observations, all of median salary
4. Calculate the mean salary for everyone at the bar
5. Calculate the median salary for everyone at the bar

#### your code 
```{python}
# import numpy
import numpy as np
# assign the salary value

# create the numpy array of 10 repeat observations

#calculate mean salary

#calculate median salary

```


#### hint

```{python eval = FALSE}
# import numpy
...... numpy .. np
# assign the salary value
med_salary = .....
# create the numpy array of 10 repeat observations
all_salaries = np.......(med_salary, 10)
#calculate mean salary
np.....(all_salaries)
#calculate median salary
np.......(all_salaries)
```

#### solution

```{python eval = FALSE}
# import numpy
import numpy as np
# assign the salary value
med_salary = 30380
# create the numpy array of 10 repeat observations
all_salaries = np.repeat(med_salary, 10)
#calculate mean salary
np.mean(all_salaries)
#calculate median salary
np.median(all_salaries)
```

### R <i class="far fa-registered"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

1. Assign the median salary to a named value
2. Create a numeric vector of 10 observations, all of median salary
3. Calculate the mean salary for everyone at the bar
4. Calculate the median salary for everyone at the bar


#### your code 
```{r}
# assign the salary value

# Create a numeric vector of 10 observations, all of median salary

#calculate mean salary

#calculate median salary


```


#### hint

```{r eval = FALSE}
# assign the salary value
med_salary <- .....
# Create a numeric vector of 10 observations, all of median salary
all_salaries <- ...(med_salary, ..)
#calculate mean salary
....(all_salaries)
#calculate median salary
......(all_salaries)
```

#### solution

```{r eval = FALSE}
# assign the salary value
med_salary <- 30380
# Create a numeric vector of 10 observations, all of median salary
all_salaries <- rep(med_salary, 10)
#calculate mean salary
mean(all_salaries)
#calculate median salary
median(all_salaries)
```

## Exercise 2b <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> 

A surprise development - Bill Gates enters the bar and takes a seat with the rest of our bar-goers. We'll assume based on [this article](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rich-is-bill-gates-net-worth-mind-blowing-facts-2019-5?r=US&IR=T#11-according-to-the-social-security-administration-the-average-american-man-with-a-bachelors-degree-will-earn-about-22-million-in-his-lifetime-gates-makes-that-in-a-little-over-an-hour-and-a-half-11) that his earnings for that year was <strong class="navy">12 billion dollars</strong>.

Exchange rate for this calculation is based on [this source](https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/GBP-USD-spot-exchange-rates-history-2019.html), where we will be using the 2019 conversion average of:

1 Pound = 1.2772 USD

1. Convert Bill's earnings into 2019 pounds.
2. Calculate the reciprocal of the exchange rate (as we want to go from USD to GBP, not the other way)

<strong class="navy">Pause for thought</strong> <i class="fa fa-question-circle" id="body"></i> 

Having recalculated the mean and median of everyone at the bar, you should have noticed that the mean had skyrocketed, but that <strong class="navy">the median did not budge</strong>. None of the 10 bar patrons had gotten any richer when Bill joined the group, so in your mind, which is the better representation of the typical bar patron here? The mean or the median?

We could continue to add more of the wealthiest people in the world [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires), without affecting the median. <strong class="navy">At which point would the median be affected?</strong>:

* Jeff Bezos
* Bernard Arnault
* Warren Buffett
* Larry Ellison
* Amancio Ortega
* Mark Zuckerberg
* Jim Walton
* Alice Walton
* Robson Walton

Once all of these super-wealthy pub-goers had joined the group at the bar, the median would no longer be the better choice of the two averages to represent the typical person at that bar. But then again, it would not be any old bar! As this would now be a hangout for the super rich, then use of the mean would be warranted. It would be more representative of the population than the median. Would the super rich clientele still count as outliers? We will come to the formal definition of outliers later. 

<strong class="navy">Pause for thought</strong> <i class="fa fa-question-circle" id="body"></i> 
Do we know of any ways to define an outlier?


### When the median isn't the message

Take a look at the [British Medical Journal's](https://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/11/03/median-not-message) response to a fantastic [essay](https://www.dancingupsidedown.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/MedianNotMessageCancer_Gould.pdf) by the evolutionary biologist, Stephen Jay Gould in 2002.

Dr Gould was diagnosed with a terminal form of cancer in the 1980s and while reading around the subject, discovered that the median survival duration following diagnosis was 8 months. Dr Gould died in 2002 of a different, unrelated form of cancer, having survived thirty times longer than the published median survival period. You can see from the BMJ article that his legacy has been a depeer consideration of medical communication of statistics.

If some significant number of patients with this disease (perhaps 20 or 30 %) go on to live long and relatively healthy lives, that absolutely matters and needs to be communicated to any person diagnosed with that disease. The use of the median here would be the wrong type of average to communicate.


<span class="summary-box">
Appropriate use of the mean or median comes down to judgement. Consideration of the distribution of the population and what any outliers mean for an analysis is crucial. Do the outliers obscure the message, or are the outliers the message?</span>


### Quick and dirty outlier determination.

Whenever you produce summary statistics for a column, you tend to see median and mean. Noticing differences (if any) between these averages can indicate the presence of outliers and in what direction. Let's have a play.


## Exercise 3a

The `ChickWeight` dataset from R's `datasets` package:

<strong class="navy>Weight versus age of chicks on different diets</strong>
<strong class="navy>Description</strong>

The ChickWeight data frame has 578 rows and 4 columns from an experiment on the effect of diet on early growth of chicks.

<img class="center" src="../../www/week_2/chicks.jpg" alt="2 small chicks standing side by side">


Type `?ChickWeight` into the R console or an R code chunk for more detail.

<strong class="navy">Please note that Python tends to refer to the median as `50%` in it's summary statistics output.</strong>

What do you notice about the mean and median? What does this mean in terms of any outliers within this columns' values?

# Variation

Another crucial feature of any group of numbers that we need to conceptualise is the dispersal of the numbers around the middle. Meaning, how spread out are the numbers, are they clustered or evenly distributed? There are a number of descriptive statistics available to us in order to explore this aspect of any numerical data:

* Range
* Inter Quartile Range (IQR)
* Variance
* Standard Deviation.


## Univariate Analysis

Univariate analysis simply means considering one variable in isolation. We can employ all of the dispersal statistics mentioned above for univariate analysis.

* **Range** is quite straight forward as I'm sure you know. Simply the maximum observed value minus the minimum observed value. Combined with an awareness of the median, this can give you an indication of skew in any population.

chicks_py = r.chicks_r
