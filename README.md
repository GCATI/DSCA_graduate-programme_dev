**Course Summary**

This repository is used to improve the continuity of the ongoing Data Science Campus' graduate scheme curriculum
development. Content delivered throughout the curriculum is resourced by Data science Campus Faculty, ONS Analytical
Learning and external providers. *Ad hoc* training materials can be stored here for future development and established
courses should be linked to within schedule.rmd.

**Course Objective**

Learners will have gained experience in calculating rates for comparison of differing-sized geographies. Learners
will have also have had the opportunity to explore quality assurance in join integrity and rate calculation.
Implementation in Python & R will be included.
