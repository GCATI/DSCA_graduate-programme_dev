# Lecturer Guidance

## Scope

This guidance is intended for any lecturers delivering material to beneficiaries of the Graduate Data Scientist curriculum. This may include **Data Science Campus** staff, colleagues from **Other ONS Departments** such as Analytical Learning or M.D.R. Capability, or external training providers.

By default, the guidance describes the typical delivery for Faculty colleagues. This may vary for other departments and these differences are documented at relevant points in the guide.

## Pre-course arrangements

### Delivery Platform

All delivery is currently remote, using **Microsoft Teams**. Appointments will be created by Campus Faculty staff, who will also invite trainers and delegates. Invites are sent out on a quarterly basis. Delegates will attend as either required or optional, depending on the requirements of the course schedule.

If an alternative delivery platform (such as Google Meets, Skype etc) is required, please contact the [Faculty Inbox](mailto:data.science.campus.faculty@ons.gov.uk) no later than 2 weeks prior to the start of the course.

### Distributing Material

All course material and any pre-course arrangements / requirements should be distributed to the **Outlook attendance list**. 

Data Science Campus also use dedicated Slack channels to distribute course instructions to delegates. This should be used to supplement Email distribution, not in place of Emailing. Please be aware that Slack channel visibility may differ to the Outlook attendance list. 

Pre-course material should be distributed prior to the day of the course. If the requirements are particularly technical or involve pre-course tasks, appropriate time for candidates to meet all requirements should be allowed. This could involve raising tickets with home organisation IT support to resolve software issues etc. Documenting issues around common bugs / barriers is best practice.


## Delivery Instructions

### Session Guidance

Please build in time for regular comfort breaks on an hourly basis.

Feel free to share links to learning materials and questions, hints etc in the chat.

### Inclusive Learning

ONS is an inclusive workplace. We require learning content to meet [accessibility standards](#placeholder).


### Unforeseen absence

It is advised that a main lecturer and copilot are identified for each session. The copilot should be capable of delivering the content in the event of unavoidable absence.

In the event of cancellation, it is crucial to contact the [Faculty Inbox](mailto:data.science.campus.faculty@ons.gov.uk) at your earliest convenience. Please indicate the course date and title in the subject of the Email and mark it as important.

### Distribution of surveys

Course feedback should be sought appropriate to the delivery method. Surveys are included with course material if delivering via the Learning Hub. Content delivered by other means should be accompanied by an appropriate Smart Survey. Please consult our Smart Survey Guidance available in our [Course Standardisation Guidance.](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/DSCA_course_standardisation)

Please distribute Smart Survey surveys on the last day of the week's planned course material.

## Post Course Arrangements

If the course provided was in an independent study format, it is best to follow up the allocated study period with a Q&A session. This will be booked in delegates calendars along with the quarterly Outlook invites. Please contact [Faculty Inbox](mailto:data.science.campus.faculty@ons.gov.uk) in order to organise Q&A sessions that suit your schedule.
