# Actions for 2021:

## BI software:

* Write scikit learn logreg equivalent for example of R implementation.
* Overhaul python / R implementation reports to compare correct vs incorrect predictions of class.
* Next year would need 4 hours, with more time for learner exploration of case studies.
* A short activity after the initial introduction to the software where participants could follow along a set of instructions
(accompanied by screenshots perhaps), which they could quickly do and be able to gauge the functionalities in powerBI and understand
where all screen elements are located.
* Pairing up and breakout rooms for tasks.

## Modular Programming:

* Improve Programming Style example

## Unit Testing:

* Add introduction example
* Earlier exercises
* More analysis focus (another case study?)
