# Actions for 2021:

## BI software:

* Write scikit learn logreg equivalent for example of R implementation.
* Overhaul python / R implementation reports to compare correct vs incorrect predictions of class.
* Next year would need 3 to 4 hours, with more time for learner exploration of case studies.  

## Modular Programming:

* Improve Programming Style example

## Unit Testing:

* Add introduction example
* Earlier exercises
* More analysis focus (another case study?)
