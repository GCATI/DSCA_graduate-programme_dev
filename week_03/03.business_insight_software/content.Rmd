Would you agree with all of the rating comparisons?
Are there any important comparisons that are missing?

Obviously, the above is promotional material. Note that I can't say from the website whether a user is a person who create or consumes the report.

Does a good job of looking more impartial, but opinionated and R-centric in my own opinion.Interesting article, I recommend reading for a take on the current dashboarding landscape.

It may also be useful to consider where you would place some of the above software, or any familiar analytical software on the reproducibility spectrum above.

### In Review

Consider the following for your project:

* Does your analysis need a dashboard?
* How data literate are your audience?
* Consider your project team. Where are their strengths and what solution presents the quickest path to the required product?
* Accessibility and quality assurance.
* Cost incurred for use case?
